<h2>Letter from the Managing Director</h2>
<p>
Welcome to Mycelial Communications! We are proud to be the market leader in the development of custom encrypted telecommunications solutions. <br>
<br>
At Mycelial Communications, we understand that any network of collaborators is only as strong as the network technology on which it operates. Additionally, we recognize the growing importance of communication security as more and more governments, NGOs and private corporations find their growth stifled by mistrust of systems in communication. <br>
<br>
Operating worldwide, we have learned over the years that our solutions need to be as unique as our clients. In light of this, we invite you explore our website to see what solutions might be appropriate for your concern; but please keep in mind that the best way to learn how you might benefit from encrypted telecom is to talk to an experienced member of our team. After you have learned more about what we can offer, please navigate to the contact form and a project manager will contact you shortly.<br>
<br>
We look forward to working with you,<br>

Aubrey Trask<br>

Managing Director<br>
